# VoiceAssistant-Bulgarian
I thought that it will be a fun idea to try to make something big and complicated,so I decided to make a voice assistant that works in Bulgarian, for the Bulgarian non-english speakers.

============================>Important!!!!<==============================

The key used to make the connection between the code and the outsource model is going to be changed, because if you try to use it, I will be charged for it. The fee is low and a small family will probably have to pay a 5-10$ yearly to keep it running without an issue.

YOU MUST CHANGE THE KEY IN THE CODE,SO YOU CAN USE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used some of OpenAi's models to make it and then combine them into this. 
Version 1 is going to be simple, no wake word, just ask it something in Bulgarian and it will respond to you!
(I am writing this in english, in case there's someone reviewing the project, wondering if they can adapt it for their language.)
Plans for version 2 : Adding a wake word! 
Plans for the future : Adapting it so it can schedule dates and meetings in the calendar!
